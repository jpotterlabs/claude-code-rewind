## 🎯 Use Case Positioning

### **When to Use Native `/rewind`** ⚡

**Perfect for**:
- **Quick experimentation**: "Let me try approach A, then rewind and try B"
- **Immediate undo**: "Oops, that broke it - rewind now"
- **Conversation recovery**: Undo both code AND conversation context
- **Rapid iteration**: Fast back-and-forth during active session
- **No setup required**: Works out-of-the-box

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
# Exploring two approaches
You: "Refactor using async/await"
Claude: [makes changes]
You: "Hmm, not sure... press Esc Esc"
Menu: "Rewind to checkpoint 3?"
You: "Yes, rewind code only"
You: "Actually, try using callbacks instead"
Claude: [different approach]
```

**Limitations**:
- ❌ Lost after 30 days
- ❌ Can't track bash command effects
- ❌ Single session - no cross-session history
- ❌ No programmatic access
- ❌ Limited metadata

---

### **When to Use Claude Code Rewind** 🏢

**Perfect for**:
- **Long-term history**: Keep snapshots indefinitely
- **Cross-session tracking**: See evolution over weeks/months
- **Compliance & audit**: Enterprise accountability requirements
- **Team collaboration**: Share snapshots and analysis
- **Complex rollbacks**: Selective file rollback, preserve some changes
- **Forensic analysis**: "What happened last week during that refactor?"
- **Automation**: Hooks, CI/CD integration, automated snapshots
- **Privacy-critical**: All data stays local
- **Comprehensive tracking**: Bash effects, external tools, concurrent changes

**Example Workflow**:
```bash
# Professional development with accountability
$ claude-rewind monitor --mode claude

# Week 1: Initial implementation
Claude: [implements feature X]
# Rewind captures: full context + reasoning

# Week 2: Refactoring
Claude: [refactors with multiple subagents]
# Rewind captures: subagent delegation chain

# Week 3: Bug discovered
$ claude-rewind timeline --filter "feature X"
# Shows: Complete 3-week evolution

$ claude-rewind diff snapshot_week1 snapshot_week3
# Forensic analysis of what changed

$ claude-rewind rollback snapshot_week2 --selective-files auth.py
# Surgical rollback preserving other progress
```

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Unlimited retention
- ✅ Full bash/external tracking
- ✅ Rich metadata (subagents, reasoning, plans)
- ✅ Local storage (privacy)
- ✅ Programmatic access
- ✅ Enterprise features

## 🔗 Complementary Usage Patterns

**★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────**
The two systems work together beautifully. Think of native `/rewind` as your **tactical undo** for active work, and Claude Code Rewind as your **strategic safety net** for the entire project lifecycle.
**─────────────────────────────────────────────────**

### **Pattern 1: Experiment Freely, Commit Safely**

```bash
# Active development session
You: "Try approach A"
Claude: [changes code]
You: "Hmm, let me see approach B"
Esc Esc → Rewind code only
You: "Try approach B"
Claude: [different changes]
You: "I like this better!"

# Now capture for permanent record
Claude Code Rewind: [automatically captured final state]
$ claude-rewind create-snapshot "Selected approach B after comparing A/B"
# Permanent record with your rationale
```

**Benefit**: Use native `/rewind` for rapid experimentation, then let Rewind capture the winner.

---

### **Pattern 2: Session-Level vs Project-Level Time Travel**

```bash
# During a session (same day)
You: "Implement feature"
Claude: [implements]
You: "Wait, go back"
Esc Esc → Rewind (fast, in-session)

# Across sessions (next week)
$ claude-rewind timeline
# Find snapshot from last week
$ claude-rewind rollback snapshot_last_week
# Cross-session time travel that native /rewind can't do
```

**Benefit**: `/rewind` for same-session undo, Rewind for cross-session archaeology.

---

### **Pattern 3: Conversation Recovery + Code Forensics**

```bash
# Lost train of thought mid-session
Esc Esc → "Rewind conversation and code to checkpoint 5"
# Restore both context and files

# Later, investigating what happened
$ claude-rewind show-reasoning snapshot_xyz
# See WHY Claude made those decisions
# (Native /rewind doesn't capture reasoning depth)
```

**Benefit**: Native tool restores session state, Rewind provides deep forensics.

Native /rewind: ❌ "Checkpoints expired"
Claude Code Rewind: ✅ Full history available
```

**2. Bash Command Tracking**
```bash
# During development
Claude: "Running npm install..."
Native /rewind: ❌ Can't track npm's file changes
Claude Code Rewind: ✅ Captures all filesystem modifications
```

**3. External Tool Integration**
```bash
# Using external formatters, linters, build tools
$ prettier --write *.js
$ eslint --fix .
$ webpack build

Claude Code Rewind: ✅ Complete cross-session timeline
```

**5. Enterprise Compliance**
```bash
# Audit requirements
"Who changed what, when, and why?"

Native /rewind: ❌ Limited to 30 days, basic context
Claude Code Rewind: ✅ Complete audit trail with reasoning
```

**6. Selective Rollback**
```bash
# Complex situation
"Keep the API changes but revert the UI changes"

Native /rewind: ❌ All-or-nothing checkpoint
Claude Code Rewind: ✅ Selective file rollback
```

**7. Local Privacy**

## 🎨 Recommended Workflow

**★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────**
Use native `/rewind` as your **tactical undo button** during active coding. Use Claude Code Rewind as your **strategic safety net** for everything else. Together, they provide complete coverage.
**─────────────────────────────────────────────────**

### **Best Practice: Layered Protection**

```bash
# Layer 1: Native /rewind (session-level, 30 days)
# Use for: Quick experiments, immediate undo, conversation recovery

# Layer 2: Claude Code Rewind (project-level, unlimited)
# Use for: Long-term history, forensics, compliance, sharing

# Layer 3: Git (team-level, permanent)
# Use for: Collaboration, releases, official history
```

### **Daily Workflow Example**

```bash
# Morning: Start monitoring
$ claude-rewind monitor --mode claude
# Rewind captures all sessions today

# During coding: Use /rewind freely
You: "Try different approaches"
Esc Esc → Rewind between attempts (fast)

# End of day: Create milestone
$ claude-rewind create-snapshot "End of day - feature complete"
# Permanent snapshot preserved

# Next week: Need yesterday's state
# Native /rewind: Still available (within 30 days)
# Claude Code Rewind: Available forever + rich context
```

## 🚀 Future Integration Opportunities

### **Potential Enhancement: Native Checkpoint Export**

```python
# If Anthropic provides checkpoint export API...
@cli.command()
def import_checkpoints():
    """Import native Claude checkpoints into Rewind."""
    checkpoints = fetch_claude_checkpoints()
    for checkpoint in checkpoints:
        snapshot = convert_checkpoint_to_snapshot(checkpoint)
        engine.store_snapshot(snapshot)

# Benefit: Best of both worlds - quick /rewind + permanent Rewind storage
```

### **Hybrid Workflow**

```bash
# Use /rewind during session
You: Experiment freely with Esc Esc

# At end of session
$ claude-rewind import-session
# Import today's checkpoints into permanent storage
# Now they're preserved beyond 30 days!
```

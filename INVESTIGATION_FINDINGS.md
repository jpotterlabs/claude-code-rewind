# üîç Investigation Findings: Original Trigger System

## Summary
The original developer **DID** design and partially implement a sophisticated trigger system. Our implementation **completes their exact architectural vision**.

## Evidence Found

### ‚úÖ Complete Interface Design
- `IClaudeHookManager` interface existed in `core/interfaces.py`
- Methods: `register_pre_action_hook()`, `register_post_action_hook()`, `start_monitoring()`, `stop_monitoring()`
- Full callback system and context management designed

### ‚úÖ Configuration Infrastructure
- `HooksConfig` class with `claude_integration_enabled: bool = True`
- `auto_snapshot_enabled: bool = True`
- Pre/post snapshot script hooks configured
- Tests validate hooks configuration exists

### ‚úÖ Planned Directory Structure
- `/hooks/` directory created with docstring "Claude Code integration hooks and interceptors"
- Only contained empty `__init__.py` with integration docstring

### ‚ùå Missing Implementation
- No concrete implementation of `IClaudeHookManager`
- Deleted design documents (`.kiro/specs/claude-rewind-tool/`)
- "watch" command was a band-aid by another developer who saw the gap

## Conclusion
Our `ClaudeHookManager` and `ClaudeCodeInterceptor` **implement the exact interface** the original developer designed. We didn't "bolt on" features - we **fulfilled their architectural vision**.

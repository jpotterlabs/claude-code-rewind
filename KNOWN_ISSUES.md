### 🐛 Diff Command File-Specific Mode Broken

**Issue**: `claude-rewind diff <snapshot> --file <filename>` fails with "Snapshot not found: current"

**Severity**: MEDIUM - Specific functionality broken

**Error**: `Failed to get file content for test1.py in current: Snapshot not found: current`

**Impact**:
- ❌ Cannot view diffs for specific files
- ✅ Full snapshot diffs work correctly
- ✅ Syntax error in diff_viewer.py fixed during testing

**Status**:
- ✅ Full diff functionality works
- ✅ Syntax highlighting and formatting work
- ❌ File-specific diff mode has snapshot resolution issue

**Required Fix**: Fix "current" snapshot resolution in file-specific diff mode

**Priority**: MEDIUM - Feature completion

**Location**: `claude_rewind/core/diff_viewer.py` current snapshot handling

## Post-Ship Bug Reports

### 🐛 Race Condition in Comprehensive Performance Tests

**Issue**: `test_performance_features.py` fails during parallel processing thread safety test

**Error**: `FileNotFoundError` during concurrent temporary file operations in storage system

**Location**:
- `test_performance_features.py:268-269` (concurrent snapshot creation)
- `file_store.py:211` (`temp_path.rename(content_path)`)

**Root Cause**: Multiple threads creating snapshots simultaneously cause race condition in temporary file management

**Impact**:
- ❌ Comprehensive performance benchmarks cannot run
- ✅ Simple performance test works fine
- ✅ All performance features work correctly in normal usage

**Workaround**: Use `simple_performance_test.py` to verify features work

**Priority**: Low (post-ship fix)

**Fix Strategy**: Implement atomic file operations with proper locking for concurrent storage operations
